Daegan joined the U.S. Marine Corps after graduating from Millard South High School. He loved the brotherhood of the Marines and was proud to serve as a member of the 2nd\u00a0Battalion, 1st\u00a0Marine Regiment at Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, California.</p> <p>Daegan\u2019s girlfriend Jessica, his mom, dad, step-mom, step-dad, 4 siblings, and grandparents are all mourning the loss of a great son, grandson, and brother. Daegan was raised in Red Oak, Iowa and the Omaha metro area and was a longtime member of the Boy Scouts. He enjoyed playing hockey for Omaha Westside in the Omaha Hockey Club and was a diehard Chicago Blackhawks fan. He loved hunting and spending time outdoors with his dad, as well as being out on the water. He was also an animal lover with a soft spot in his heart for dogs.</p> <p>Daegan always looked forward to coming home and hanging out with his family and many buddies in Nebraska. To his younger siblings, he was their favorite jungle gym and to his friends, he was a genuinely happy guy that you could always count on. After finishing his enlistment, Daegan planned to come home and go to a local trade school, possibly to become a lineman.</p> <p>Daegan will always be remembered for his tough outer shell and giant heart. Our hearts are broken, but we are thankful for the friends and family who are surrounding us during this time. Our thoughts and prayers are also with the other Marine and Navy families whose loved ones died alongside Daegan.</p> <ul> <li>Statement from the Page family to KETV</li> </ul> Images <p></p> Social Media <ul> <li>https://x.com/bennyjohnson/status/1431382594311106565?s=20</li> </ul> Additional Articles <ul> <li>KETV Omaha</li> </ul>","tags":["Afghanistan"]},{"location":"blog/13-service-members-were-killed-in-afghanistan-heres-who-they-are/#darin-taylor-hoover","title":"Darin Taylor Hoover","text":"Info <p>Rank: Marine Corps Staff Sergeant</p> <p>Age: 31</p> <p>Location: Sandy, Utah</p> Images <p> </p> Social Media <ul> <li>https://twitter.com/GovCox/status/1431379530313175040</li> <li>https://twitter.com/LGHendersonUtah/status/1431385832548536320</li> <li>https://twitter.com/KSL_AlexCabrero/status/1431392814688968705</li> </ul> Additional Articles <ul> <li>KSLTV Salt Lake City</li> </ul>","tags":["Afghanistan"]},{"location":"blog/13-service-members-were-killed-in-afghanistan-heres-who-they-are/#david-lee-espinoza","title":"David Lee Espinoza","text":"Info <p>Rank: Marine Corps Lance Corporal</p> <p>Age: 20</p> <p>Location: Rio Bravo, Texas</p> Images <p></p> Quote <p>City of Rio Bravo is mourning the loss of one of our own \ud83d\ude4f</p> <p>Beside his grave old glory waved for his country his life he gave, staring at his name etched in stone, he gave all and is not alone, looking up all I could see, were sacrifices made for you and me, tears of sorrow rolled down my face, what I would give to take his place, hard to express my feelings inside, empty and helpless most of all pride, we mourn our loss and our souls greive, he fought and died for what he believed, our flag will fly our anthem will play, never taking for granted our freedom today, priceless are the memories of our time together, the difference he made will last forever, I took my wife\u2019s hand and we walked away, we buried our son a fallen hero today.</p> <p>Thank you for your Service David Lee Espinoza, City of Rio Bravo is mourning the loss of a HERO</p> <ul> <li>Gilbert Aguilar Jr, Mayor of Rio Bravo, TX</li> </ul> Social Media <ul> <li>https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=355842769338776&amp;id=100047391670968</li> <li>https://www.facebook.com/cityoflaredo/photos/a.1137173819634628/4632972573388051/?type=3</li> </ul> Additional Articles <ul> <li>KGNS Laredo</li> <li>The News Tribune</li> </ul>","tags":["Afghanistan"]},{"location":"blog/13-service-members-were-killed-in-afghanistan-heres-who-they-are/#dylan-r-merola","title":"Dylan R.

After all, We The People control the government and deserve to know what is going on. However, as with so many things involving the administration, that has shown to be a complete lie.</p> <p>The most recent demonstration of withholding information involves the Haitian migrants at the southern U.S. border, of which an estimated 14,000 camped out underneath an overpass near Del Rio, Texas. The Biden Administration was determined to remove the Haitians from the terrible conditions of the area. So, they vowed to\u2026 release the majority of them in the U.S. without requiring them to obtain citizenship?</p> <p>In addition, Biden criticized his own Border Patrol agents after images showing agents on horseback were misconstrued and believed to show that whips were being used. Several photographers who were there stated that the supposed \u201cwhips\u201d were just the reins used to control the horses. But the Biden Administration pressed on with the false narrative, stating that they will \u201cmake them pay\u201d.</p> <p>Sadly, this isn't the first time the Biden Administration has done something absurd and it certainly won't be the last. More and more examples of this \"clear as mud\" transparency come from the White House. As more and more Americans either concede and receive the Covid vaccination or stand staunch with refusal, everyone is becoming warier of the advice and guidance offered by those we look to for leadership. Many question the logic of a \"[war] between the vaccinated and the unvaccinated\". And more and more are questioning \"If I'm vaccinated, why do I care if the other is?\" The administration assures you that it's because you can still transmit Covid and you can still fall ill to the virus despite being vaccinated.</p> <p>The hypocrisy and criticism to questioning is being more and more scrutinized, which draws a new set of questions. But of course, we're not able to ask those questions. \"Follow the science\" they so eagerly declare. Yet they ignore the science when it involves another heartbeat, another human being, can be terminated without its consent. \"My body, my choice\" they scream. Yet when you decline to receive the vaccination, it suddenly becomes \"not a matter of freedom\" and \"you're killing grandma\".</p> <p>Asking questions is considered to be the worst thing you can do according to the Democratic party. The Biden administration expects that we'll follow blindly. They forget a majority issue with that: the American people don't follow blindly. Yet, they hold out hope.</p> <p>Recently, a panel of CDC scientists reached a 16-2 consensus that Americans did not need any booster shots, at least for the foreseeable future. However, the director of the CDC, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, overruled the panel, allowing boosters to be administered to those considered to be \u201chigh-risk\u201d and frontline workers, further muddying the waters on whose telling the truth.</p> <p>Transparency has never been something the Biden\u2019s have been good at, though. A recent report by the Congressional Research Service revealed that the sitting president owes up to $500K in back taxes. The report came out just days after Biden stated that everyone \u201cneeds to pay their fair share\u201d. Emails from Hunter Biden\u2019s laptop also reveal a connection between them while in the White House in 2015 and China.</p> <p>The Biden\u2019s \u2014 and Democrats \u2014 will lie to make anything fit their narrative so they can get what they want. They\u2019re worse than the playground bullies you dealt with in elementary school. In comparison, though, those bullies are significantly smarter.</p>"},{"location":"blog/covid-vaccination-the-new-religion/","title":"COVID vaccination: the new religion","text":"<p>\"You're not welcome here.\" That's the message you'll most likely get in any majority liberal area if you are not currently 'vaccinated' against Covid-19. I say vaccinated in air quotes only because the vaccine doesn't prevent you from contracting or spreading the virus. Instead, it provides a \"layer of defense\" against the virus that is far weaker than what your immune system can provide. But in today's world, natural immunity is no longer spoken of and is only a figment of your delusional imagination.</p> <p>The new standards set by the government are absurd. \"Get the jab or lose your job\" is the new standard, causing the crisis in the supply chain due to a lack of workers, and a new crisis that may hit the military in the coming weeks due to members refusing the jab. Why work when the government is handing out your paycheck to other able-bodied workers? Why work when you can be the recipient of another worker's paycheck? After all, it's a lot easier for you. And still, the government wonders why we are having a crisis.</p> <p>But never fear! Biden and his loving administration will save us! This supply chain shortage is simply a result of Americans having more money to spend on goods, according to Pete Buttigieg who just returned from two months of paid paternity leave. Curious, considering how gas is now at a national average of $3.35 a gallon. A year ago, it was at an average of $1.78. So what happened there?</p> <p>\"It's not about your freedoms.\" Terrifying statements coming from our president, considering he doesn't even remember what he's doing at any given moment. In a recent Town Hall with CNN, Biden had to ask where he was and stood with his fists clenched the entire time. The man couldn't form 90% of his sentences without stumbling through them like a toddler learning to talk.</p> <p>But remember, he's our President and you're not allowed to badmouth a Democratic President. If you do, you're labeled a domestic terrorist. Especially if you go against the liberal ideologies the school boards are wanting to teach your children. Oh, and you're not allowed to tell the school boards what they can and cannot teach your kids. That's rude, and you will be labeled a domestic terrorist by the Department of Justice. But it's not rude to post a picture of a look-alike severed head of the current president in 2017. That was in the taste of comedy, right?</p> <p>But back to Covid.</p> <p>Dr. Fauci has given the green light for all Halloween traditions, the moment we've all been waiting for. But it's too early to tell for Christmas, according to the liberal Lord. Many Americans have given the finger to Fauci, Biden, and the whole circus currently in charge of this country, doing what they want, when they want, and how they want. After all, they're American citizens with the freedom to do that.</p> <p>But liberals don't want you to think like that. Years ago, they were the party of resistance, where you joined to resist what others told you. You resisted the government. You resisted capitalism (for some reason). Now, they are the party of 'tolerance'... unless you don't agree with them. They are the party of 'acceptance'... unless you go against their specific beliefs (i.e., being gay and conservative). They are the party where 'you need to follow the experts'... when the experts don't even know what is going on. And you can only follow who they deem to be 'experts'.</p> <p>Recently, documents have come out detailing the lab experiments that were being conducted on dogs within a lab in Tunisia. Scientists there, under the direction of Fauci, have been injecting beagles with disease-causing parasites in the name of science. But don\u2019t worry, he\u2019s an \u2018expert\u2019 that lied to Congress under oath. All praise! But make sure you have your St. Fauci candle lit while you do so.</p> <p>The entire premise that Fauci was built upon has only gone to show that those in power will say and do anything to stay in power. Fauci has been in his position of Director of the NIH since 1984, ironically when George Orwell's book is set that warns us of the US government attempting to turn into an authoritarian state.</p> <p>Now, with several lawsuits filed against the sitting president and many of his associates for various reasons, many relating to the Covid vaccine mandate, American citizens who aren't consumed by the mainstream media wonder \"what happens now?\". The answer is to hold your ground, keep fighting, and give them nothing. They've taken way too much, and it's time to take it back.</p>","tags":["Anthony Fauci","Coronavirus","religion"]},{"location":"blog/domain-outage--website-redesign/","title":"Domain Outage &amp; Website Redesign","text":""},{"location":"blog/domain-outage--website-redesign/#outage","title":"Outage","text":"<p>On April 13 at roughly 8:30 am CST, Thacker Broadcasting noticed that our email domain was being awfully quiet and began looking into the issue.

And you have several individuals you can thank for that. Namely President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. The complete pull-out of US forces from Afghanistan was a complete disaster. No effort was made to preserve the lives of our allies within the area. No efforts were made to remove mission-critical equipment, of which so much was left behind. After fighting in this war since 2001, many Americans feel betrayed. Those who have lost loved ones to the first war American has \u201clost\u201d. What were those lives lost for? To give up? Call it a day when we got tired of what we were doing? And a better question: why did the Biden Administration think it was a good idea to just leave the Taliban as it was? Any American with a shred of decency could see that this was going to happen. And so, Thacker Broadcasting issues the statement of \u201cShame on You, Biden.

And neither is the Biden Administration. Last week, President Joe Biden announced that any business with 100 or more employees must get everyone vaccinated, or show negative COVID tests at least once a week, or face fines up to $14,000 per infraction.</p> <p>The absurdity is outrageous, and the irony almost palpable. So how is Joe Biden able to do this without mass outrage? The answer is simple \u2014 he isn\u2019t.</p> <p>Biden claims that the US Department of Labor is drafting the emergency declaration that will be implemented through the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA. However, OSHA has expressed that they simply don\u2019t have the authority to force American citizens to make a medical decision they don\u2019t agree with \u2014 that\u2019s not what OSHA\u2019s job is. And while the Biden Administration keeps touting various levels of power that they simply do not have, laws are being passed on these matters without public opinion or approval. All in the name of \u201cPublic Health\u201d.</p> <p>COVID has become such a politicized topic that has divided the Republicans from the Democrats more than President Trump ever did. So much so that Biden\u2019s approval rating has tanked to just above 40%, the lowest approval rating so far with the administration. And it\u2019s steadily declining.</p> <p>But wasn\u2019t Biden the most popular presidential candidate? Isn\u2019t that why he won the election? Surely he couldn\u2019t get elected with that sort of approval rating! The answer is quite simple, and Democrats refuse to acknowledge them \u2014 the media, and the behind-the-scenes.</p> <p>With election audits coming to a close in swing states like Arizona, Pennsylvania, and Georgia, it\u2019s becoming more and more clear that something weird went on in those states during the election period. Democrats have declared time and time again that Trump was spouting unsupported claims about the election being stolen. And while they may have been far-fetched at best, the election no longer holds the legitimacy it once did.</p> <p>The media has been largely blamed for influencing elections in the past. However, this last election showed just how much influence they can have. After criticizing every little thing Trump did, whether it was good or bad, Biden graced the political landscape again and he could do no wrong in their eyes. Trump was a threat to them and their integrity, stating what thousands of Americans have come to realize \u2014 you\u2019re fake news.</p> <p>By taking everything political, and twisting it to fit their political narrative, the mainstream media was able to paint Trump as a dictator, a racist, a xenophobe, among several other titles. Trump\u2019s entire history was dug up, lives were ruined at the cost of the media painting Trump in a bad light. But they didn\u2019t care, and they still don\u2019t. After all, they were protecting their integrity.</p> <p>However, once Biden appeared, he could do no wrong in their eyes. A sudden shift in the narrative captured people\u2019s attention and captivated them. Several times it was declared that Trump was terrible, and Biden was a godsend. \u201cBiden can fix the country,\u201d they said. \u201cVote blue!\u201d</p> <p>Now, nine months into the presidential disaster, the media is running out of nice things to say about the sitting President. He won\u2019t answer their questions. He, while inadvertently, killed several hundred Americans by botching the Afghanistan withdrawal, including thirteen service members. Then he proceeded to drone the wrong guy \u2014 an Afghan ally nonetheless \u2014 to bring a show of power back to his administration. And how did the media respond?</p> <p>\u201cThe Afghanistan airport explosion happened under Biden but traces back to Trump\u201d (NBC News)</p> <p>\u201cStop Blaming Biden for Afghanistan. He\u2019s Cleaning Up Trump\u2019s Mess\u201d (Newsweek)</p> <p>Blame Trump! He\u2019s the one that started the withdrawal! It\u2019s his fault! He killed those Americans!</p> <p>While true that Trump started the withdrawal, Trump had nothing to do with the complete botch that only the Biden administration could facilitate. But there were flaws in that logic, and the majority of people saw through it: how could the Trump administration be to blame when they weren\u2019t in office? How could you blame somebody for something that they haven\u2019t had control over for almost eight months? Nobody could answer that, and the narrative was quickly dropped, never to be spoken of again.</p> <p>After that disaster, the administration thought they could mend broken trust amongst the people. Biden needed to visit the families of those service members that had been killed; they had given the Ultimate Sacrifice. But several of these visits to families were turned down, citing that they didn\u2019t want to meet the man who was responsible for the highly avoidable fiasco, the one responsible for them never being able to see their loved one again.</p> <p>Those that did accept the visit stated that Biden only wanted to talk about his son Beau, and paid little to no regard for their loss. Another PR disaster.</p> <p>And as a symbolic nail in the coffin, as the service member's remains were brought back to American soil, Biden didn\u2019t even have the dignity to pay them the respect they so deserved. Instead, he was more worried about what time it was, checking his watch after every transfer. His thoughts consisted exclusively of \u201cWhen\u2019s ice cream?\u201d.</p> <p>The media tried to run a cover of this, even doing a \u201cfact check\u201d stating that he hadn\u2019t checked his watch every time, only three. However, that article was retracted several days later due to video evidence showing the opposite, and the outlet was forced to apologize.</p> <p>The media\u2019s love for Democrats has shown for several years, since at least the Obama presidency. And they\u2019ve recently shown just how low they will stoop to get the candidates they want to be elected, and how much they are willing to lie to get you to believe their stories. After all, you\u2019re just a peasant who gives them money and does whatever they say.</p>","tags":["Afghanistan","Coronavirus"]},{"location":"blog/acquisition-z96-the-mix/","title":"ACQUISITION: Z96 The Mix","text":"<p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</p> <p>In a recent deal made between Z96 The Mix and Thacker Broadcasting, Z96 has agreed to become an asset of Thacker Broadcasting.
