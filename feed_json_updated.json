The attack was one of the deadliest days for American forces in the past decade of the 20-year war, and is criticized as one that could have been avoided had President Joe Biden not called for the disastrous timeline of the withdrawal from the region, which all military members were supporting under the name Operational Freedom's Sentinel.
