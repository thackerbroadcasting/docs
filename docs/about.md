## Our History

Thacker Broadcasting started as an idea in 2019. Aimed at taking on the radio broadcast industry, Thacker Broadcasting had a few hoops it had to jump through before anything else would come next. Now, Thacker Broadcasting is licensed as an LLC and aims at helping clients find broadcast solutions for their business or personal use.
