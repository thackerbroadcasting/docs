Welcome to the Thacker Broadcasting Docs site. Here, we document everything relating to our site(s), its operations, business operations, legal and product documentation, FAQs, and more.

## Nice to know
Each page has dates listed at the bottom indicating Last updated date (:material-clock-edit-outline:) and Creation date (:material-clock-plus-outline:). These serve as an indicator in helping you determine when our last update to the item was. If there are any mistypes or things you feel should be corrected, you may do so by clicked the pencil in the top right of each page (:material-pencil:).

## Layout
Our site is layed out as such:

- Each menu may contain multiple sub-categories or sections, which are laid out on the left side of the page
- Headers (and other important points) for each page are listed on the right side titled "On this page". This is especially useful when you may be looking for a particular section in a document.
- Our header contains a search bar to help you find items on the site. Additionally, our public repository where this documentation is hosted lives beside it.
- Our footer contains our copyright, support desk (titled "Submit a ticket"), the ability to change your cookie settings, and our social media.
