Welcome to the Thacker Broadcasting Docs site. Here, we document everything relating to our site(s), its operations, business operations, legal and product documentation, FAQs, and more.

## Layout
Our site is laid out as such:

- Menu bars contain "Categories" of items, such as Legal or FAQs
- Each menu may contain multiple sub-categories or sections, which are laid out on the left side of the page
- Headers (and other important points) for each page are listed on the right side titled "On this page". This is especially useful when you may be looking for a particular section in a document.
- Our header contains a search bar to help you find items on the site. Additionally, our public repository where this documentation is hosted lives beside it.
- Our footer contains our copyright, support desk (titled "Submit a ticket"), the ability to change your cookie settings, and our social media.
