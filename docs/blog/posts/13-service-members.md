# 13 service members were killed in Afghanistan. Here‚Äôs who they are

A devastating attack on Thursday, August 26, 2021 outside of the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, Afghanistan, killed 13 U.S. service members: eleven Marines, one Navy Corpsman, and one Army Soldier. The attack was one of the deadliest days for American forces in the past decade of the 20-year war, and is criticized as one that could have been avoided had President Joe Biden not called for the disastrous timeline of the withdrawal from the region, which all military members were supporting under the name Operational Freedom's Sentinel. Here's who the deceased are.

## Daegan William-Tyeler Page
???+ info
    **Rank:** Marine Corps Corporal

    **Age:** 23

    **Location:** Omaha, Nebraska

    ???+ quote
        Our beloved son, Corporal Daegan William-Tyeler Page, 23, was killed in Afghanistan yesterday. Daegan joined the U.S. Marine Corps after graduating from Millard South High School. He loved the brotherhood of the Marines and was proud to serve as a member of the 2nd¬†Battalion, 1st¬†Marine Regiment at Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, California.

        Daegan‚Äôs girlfriend Jessica, his mom, dad, step-mom, step-dad, 4 siblings, and grandparents are all mourning the loss of a great son, grandson, and brother. Daegan was raised in Red Oak, Iowa and the Omaha metro area and was a longtime member of the Boy Scouts. He enjoyed playing hockey for Omaha Westside in the Omaha Hockey Club and was a diehard Chicago Blackhawks fan. He loved hunting and spending time outdoors with his dad, as well as being out on the water. He was also an animal lover with a soft spot in his heart for dogs.

        Daegan always looked forward to coming home and hanging out with his family and many buddies in Nebraska. To his younger siblings, he was their favorite jungle gym and to his friends, he was a genuinely happy guy that you could always count on. After finishing his enlistment, Daegan planned to come home and go to a local trade school, possibly to become a lineman.

        Daegan will always be remembered for his tough outer shell and giant heart. Our hearts are broken, but we are thankful for the friends and family who are surrounding us during this time. Our thoughts and prayers are also with the other Marine and Navy families whose loved ones died alongside Daegan.

        City of Rio Bravo is mourning the loss of one of our own üôè

        Beside his grave old glory waved for his country his life he gave, staring at his name etched in stone, he gave all and is not alone, looking up all I could see, were sacrifices made for you and me, tears of sorrow rolled down my face, what I would give to take his place, hard to express my feelings inside, empty and helpless most of all pride, we mourn our loss and our souls greive, he fought and died for what he believed, our flag will fly our anthem will play, never taking for granted our freedom today, priceless are the memories of our time together, the difference he made will last forever, I took my wife‚Äôs hand and we walked away, we buried our son a fallen hero today.

        Thank you for your Service David Lee Espinoza, City of Rio Bravo is mourning the loss of a HERO
