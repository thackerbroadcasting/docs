Here’s who they are&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;A devastating attack on Thursday, August 26, 2021 outside of the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul, Afghanistan, killed 13 U.S. service members: eleven Marines, one Navy Corpsman, and one Army Soldier. The attack was one of the deadliest days for American forces in the past decade of the 20-year war, and is criticized as one that could have been avoided had President Joe Biden not called for the disastrous timeline of the withdrawal from the region, which all military members were supporting under the name Operational Freedom&#39;s Sentinel.

I say vaccinated in air quotes only because the vaccine doesn&#39;t prevent you from contracting or spreading the virus. Instead, it provides a &#34;layer of defense&#34; against the virus that is far weaker than what your immune system can provide. But in today&#39;s world, natural immunity is no longer spoken of and is only a figment of your delusional imagination.&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://docs.thackerbroadcasting.com/blog/covid-vaccination-the-new-religion/</link> <pubDate>Sat, 13 Jan 2024 23:26:43 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://docs.thackerbroadcasting.com/feed_rss_updated.xml">Thacker Broadcasting Docs</source><guid isPermaLink="true">https://docs.thackerbroadcasting.com/blog/covid-vaccination-the-new-religion/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Domain Outage &amp; Website Redesign</title> <author>thackmaster</author> <category>Updates</category> <description>&lt;h1&gt;Domain Outage &amp;amp; Website Redesign&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Outage&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;On April 13 at roughly 8:30 am CST, Thacker Broadcasting noticed that our email domain was being awfully quiet...&lt;/p&gt;</description><link>https://docs.thackerbroadcasting.com/blog/domain-outage--website-redesign/</link> <pubDate>Sat, 13 Jan 2024 23:26:43 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://docs.thackerbroadcasting.com/feed_rss_updated.xml">Thacker Broadcasting Docs</source><guid isPermaLink="true">https://docs.thackerbroadcasting.com/blog/domain-outage--website-redesign/</guid> </item> <item> <title>New Websites</title> <author>thackmaster</author> <category>Press Release</category> <category>acquisition</category> <description>&lt;h1&gt;New Websites&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thacker Broadcasting, LLC is pleased to reveal two new websites that it will be managing:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;[Elder Tanner Layton](https://eldertannerlayton....&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description><link>https://docs.thackerbroadcasting.com/blog/new-websites/</link> <pubDate>Sat, 13 Jan 2024 23:26:43 +0000</pubDate><source url="https://docs.thackerbroadcasting.com/feed_rss_updated.xml">Thacker Broadcasting Docs</source><guid isPermaLink="true">https://docs.thackerbroadcasting.com/blog/new-websites/</guid> </item> <item> <title>Statement of Events - 8.17.21</title> <author>thackmaster</author> <category>Press Release</category> <description>&lt;h1&gt;Statement of Events - 8.17.21&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;./statement-of-events-81721/Statement%20of%20Events%20-%208.17.21.pdf&#34;&gt;PDF Version&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH.

And neither is the Biden Administration. Last week, President Joe Biden announced that any business with 100 or more employees must get everyone vaccinated, or show negative COVID tests at least once a week, or face fines up to $14,000 per infraction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The absurdity is outrageous, and the irony almost palpable. So how is Joe Biden able to do this without mass outrage?
